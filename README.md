The Jakarta XML Binding provides an API and tools that automate the mapping
between XML documents and Java objects.

The Jakarta XML Binding framework enables developers to perform the following operations:
- Unmarshal XML content into a Java representation
- Access and update the Java representation
- Marshal the Java representation of the XML content into XML content

Jakarta XML Binding gives Java developers an efficient and standard way of mapping between XML and Java code.
Java developers using Jakarta XML Binding are more productive because they can write less code themselves
and do not have to be experts in XML. Jakarta XML Binding makes it easier for developers to extend
their applications with XML and Web Services technologies.
