# JAXB

The Javaâ„¢ Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) provides an API and tools that automate the mapping between XML documents and Java objects.

The JAXB framework enables developers to perform the following operations:
- Unmarshal XML content into a Java representation
- Access and update the Java representation
- Marshal the Java representation of the XML content into XML content

JAXB gives Java developers an efficient and standard way of mapping between XML and Java code. Java developers using JAXB are more productive because they can write less code themselves and do not have to be experts in XML. JAXB makes it easier for developers to extend their applications with XML and Web Services technologies.

:warning: This project is now part of the EE4J initiative. This repository

EE4J transition status.

# Codemodel
Codemodel is an independent library for java code generation, which is released separately and integrated in JAXB. 
Besides JAXB it is used in [istack-commons-project](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-istack-commons), 
which in turn is a dependency of JAXB
