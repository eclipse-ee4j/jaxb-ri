From 1.0 (2003/04/03)
=====================

- Fixed a bug in the parsing of:

  <xs:element name="foo" substitutionGroup="bar" />
  
  (2003/04/04)

- AnnotationParser was changed from an interface to an abstract class.
  This allows future versions to add new methods without breaking
  existing clients.
