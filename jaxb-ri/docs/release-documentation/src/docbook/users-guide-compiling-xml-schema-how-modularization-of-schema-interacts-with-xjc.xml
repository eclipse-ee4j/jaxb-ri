    <title>How modularization of schema interacts with XJC</title>

    <para>Over time schema authors have developed several techniques to
    modularize large schemas. Some of those techniques have some noteworthy
    interactions with XJC.</para>

    <section xml:id="Chameleon_schema">
        <title>Chameleon schema</title>

        <para><link
        xlink:href="http://www.xfront.com/ZeroOneOrManyNamespaces.html#mixed">Chameleon
        schema"</link> (<link
        xlink:href="http://www.google.com/search?q=chameleon+schema">read
        more</link>, in particular <link
        xlink:href="http://www.kohsuke.org/xmlschema/XMLSchemaDOsAndDONTs.html#avoid_chameleon">this</link>)
        is a technique used to define multiple almost-identical sets of
        definitions into multiple namespaces from a single schema
        document.</para>

        <para>For example, with this technique, you can write just one "foo"
        complex type and define it into namespace X and Y. In this case, one
        tends to hope that XJC will only give you one <literal>Foo</literal> class
        for this, but unfortunately because it's actually defined in two
        namespaces, JAXB needs two Java classes to distinguish <literal>X:foo</literal> and
        <literal>Y:foo</literal>, so you'll get multiple copies.</para>

        <para>If you find this to be problematic, there are a few ways to work
        around the problem.</para>

        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>If you are in control of the schema, see if you can
                rewrite the schema to avoid using this technique. In some
                cases, the schema doesn't actually exploit the additional
                power of this technique, so this translation can be done
                without affecting XML instance documents. In some other cases,
                the chameleon schema can be argued as a bad schema design, as
                it duplicates definitions in many places.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>If you are not in control of the schema, see if you can
                rewrite the schema nevertheless. This will only work if your
                transformation doesn't affect XML instance documents.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>Perhaps there can be a plugin that eases the pain of
                this, such as by defining common interfaces among
                copies.</para>
