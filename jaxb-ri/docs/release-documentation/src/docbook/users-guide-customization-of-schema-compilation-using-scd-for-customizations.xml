    <title>Using SCD for customizations</title>

    <para>When using an external customization file, the JAXB spec requires
    that you use XPath as a means to specify what your customization is
    attached to. For example, if you want to change the class name generated
    from a complex type, you'd write something like:</para>

    <example>
        <title>External customization example</title>

        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bindings xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb" version="2.0" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <bindings schemaLocation="../path/to/my.xsd" node="/xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name='foo']">
    <class name="FooType"/>
  </bindings>
</bindings>]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>While the above process works, the problem with this is that the
    XPath+ <literal>schemaLocation</literal> combo tends to be verbose and error
    prone. It's verbose, because often a trivial target schema component like
    this "global complex type foo" takes up a lot of characters. The xs
    namespace declaration also takes up some space, although in this case we
    managed to avoid declaring the "tns" namespace (that represents the
    namespace that the schema defines.)</para>

    <para>It's also error prone, because it relies on the way schema documents
    are laid out, because the schemaLocation attribute needs to point to the
    right schema document file. When a schema is split into multiple files for
    modularity (happens especially often with large schemas), then you'd have
    to find which schema file it is. Even though you can use relative paths,
    this hard-coding of path information makes it hard to pass around the
    binding file to other people.</para>

    <para>JAXB RI 2.1 and onward offers a better way to do this as a vendor
    extension.</para>

    <para>The key technology to solve this problem is a <link
    xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-ref/">"<literal>schema component
    designator</literal>"</link> (SCD.) This is a path language just like XPath, but
    whereas XPath is designed to refer to XML infoset items like elements and
    attributes, SCD is designed to refer to schema components like element
    declarations or complex types.</para>

    <para>With SCD, the above binding can be written more concisely as
    follows:</para>

    <example>
        <title>External customization by SCD</title>

        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bindings xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb" version="2.1" xmlns:tns="http://my.namespace/">
  <bindings scd="/type::tns:foo">
    <class name="FooType"/>
  </bindings>
</bindings>]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para><code>/type::tns:foo</code> can be written more concisely as
    <code>/~tns:foo</code>, too. If you are interested in more about the
    syntax of SCDs, read <link
    xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-ref/#section-path-examples">the
    example part of the spec</link>, and maybe <link
    xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-ref/#section-path-ebnf">EBNF</link>.
    If you know XPath, I think you'll find this fairly easy to learn.</para>

    <para>Another benefit of an SCD is that tools will have easier time
    generating SCDs than XPath, as XPaths are often vulnerable to small
    changes in the schema document, while SCDs are much more robust. The
    downside of using SCD is as of JAXB 2.1, this feature is a vendor
    extension and not defined in the spec.</para>
