    <title>Generating Schema that you want</title>

    <para>This section discusses how you can change the generated XML schema.
    For changes that also affect the infoset (such as changing elements to
    attributes, namespaces, etc.), refer to a different section "XML
    layout and in-memory data layout".</para>

        <title>Adding facets to datatypes</title>

        <para>As of JAXB 2.1.4, currently no support for this, although there
        has been several discussions in the users alias.</para>

        <para>The JAXB project is currently lacking resources to attack this
        problem, and therefore looking for volunteers to work on this project.
        The basic idea would be to define enough annotations to cover the
        basic constraint facets (such as length, enumerations, pattern, etc.)
        The schema generator would have to be then extended to honor those
        annotations and generate schemas accordingly.</para>
