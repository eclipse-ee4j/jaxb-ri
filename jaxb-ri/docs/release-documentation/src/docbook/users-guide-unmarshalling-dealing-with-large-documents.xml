    <title>Dealing with large documents</title>

    <para>JAXB API is designed to make it easy to read the whole XML document
    into a single tree of JAXB objects. This is the typical use case, but in
    some situations this is not desirable. Perhaps:</para>

    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>A document is huge and therefore the whole may not fit the
            memory.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            <para>A document is a live stream of XML (such as <link
            xlink:href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</link>) and therefore you
            can't wait for the EOF.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
            <para>You only need to databind the portion of a document and
            would like to process the rest in other XML APIs.</para>
        </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>This section discusses several advanced techniques to deal with
    these situations.</para>

    <section xml:id="Processing_a_document_by_chunk">
        <title>Processing a document by chunk</title>

        <para>When a document is large, it's usually because there's
        repetitive parts in it. Perhaps it's a purchase order with a large
        list of line items, or perhaps it's an XML log file with large number
        of log entries.</para>

        <para>This kind of XML is suitable for chunk-processing; the main idea
        is to use the StAX API, run a loop, and unmarshal individual chunks
        separately. Your program acts on a single chunk, and then throws it
        away. In this way, you'll be only keeping at most one chunk in memory,
        which allows you to process large documents.</para>

        <para>See the streaming-unmarshalling example and the
        partial-unmarshalling example in the JAXB RI distribution for more
        about how to do this. The streaming-unmarshalling example has an
        advantage that it can handle chunks at arbitrary nest level, yet it
        requires you to deal with the push model --- JAXB unmarshaller will
        "<literal>push</literal>" new chunk to you and you'll need to process them right
        there.</para>

        <para>In contrast, the partial-unmarshalling example works in a pull
        model (which usually makes the processing easier), but this approach
        has some limitations in databinding portions other than the repeated
        part.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="Processing_a_live_stream_of_XML">
        <title>Processing a live stream of XML</title>

        <para>The techniques discussed above can be used to handle this case
        as well, since they let you unmarshal chunks one by one. See the
        xml-channel example in the JAXB RI distribution for more about how to
        do this.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="Creating_virtual_infosets">
        <title>Creating virtual infosets</title>

        <para>For further advanced cases, one could always run a streaming
        infoset conversion outside JAXB API and basically curve just the
        portion of the infoset you want to data-bind, and feed it as a
        complete infoset into JAXB API. JAXB API accepts XML infoset in many
        different forms (DOM, SAX, StAX), so there's a fair amount of
        flexibility in choosing the right trade off between the development
        effort in doing this and the runtime performance.</para>

        <para>For more about this, refer to the respective XML infoset
        API.</para>
