        This example shows how the use of the jxb:implClass customization and 
        substitution groups can be used to inject virtual functions into the 
        derived Java hierarchy. It compares two equivalent ways of achieving 
        the same processing, but one is much simpler than the other (search for 
        the "enlightened" boolean flag in the code).
