    <title>locator-support</title>
    <description><![CDATA[
        This sample shows how to use the new non-standard locator support.  By 
        following the instructions in the readme.txt file, you can cause all of 
        the generated impl classes to implement a new interface that provides 
        more information about error locations.  When a ValidationEvent happens 
        on your content tree, simply retrieve the object and cast it down to 
        <tt>com.sun.xml.bind.extra.Locatable</tt>.
